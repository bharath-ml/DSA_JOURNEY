# 🚀 DSA_JOURNEY
Hey This is Bharath
Welcome to my **100 Days of DSA Challenge** 👨‍💻  
This repository documents my **3-month Data Structures & Algorithms plan** (Deadline: **November**) where I aim to become a **DSA Master** by practicing concepts, patterns, and interview-level problems.  

---

## 📌 Plan Overview
Instead of coding *every single problem*, I follow the **80/20 rule** — solving **20% of problems** that cover **80% of patterns and interview questions**.  
Each concept includes:
- 🔑 Core concepts & patterns  
- 💡 Handpicked problems (LeetCode, GFG, etc.)  
- ✍️ Notes, cheat sheets & self-explanations  

---
## Tips:
- ⏰ Daily revision before sleep → *self-explanation*
- 🧠 Practice all algos in each topic
